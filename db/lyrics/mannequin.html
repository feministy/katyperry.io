<!-- start of lyrics -->
How do I get<br />
Closer to you<br />
When you keep<br />
It all on mute<br />
How will I know<br />
The right way<br />
To love you<br />
<br />
Usually the queen<br />
Of figuring out<br />
Breaking down a man<br />
Is no work out<br />
But I have no clue<br />
How to get<br />
Through to you<br />
<br />
I wanna hit you<br />
Just to see<br />
If you cry<br />
I keep knocking on wood<br />
Hoping there's<br />
A real boy inside<br />
<br />
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br />
But you're not a man<br />
You're just a mannequin<br />
I wish you could feel<br />
That my love is real<br />
<br />
But you're not a man<br />
<br />
I wish<br />
I could just<br />
Turn you on<br />
Put a battery in<br />
And make you talk<br />
Even pull<br />
A string for you<br />
To say anything<br />
<br />
But with you<br />
There is no guarantee<br />
Only expired warranty<br />
A bunch<br />
Of broken parts<br />
And I can't seem<br />
To find your heart<br />
<br />
I'm such a fool<br />
I'm such a fool<br />
I'm such a fool<br />
Cause this one's<br />
Outta my hands<br />
I can't put you<br />
Back together again<br />
<br />
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br />
Cause you're not a man<br />
You're just a Mannequin<br />
I wish you could feel<br />
That my love is real<br />
You're just a toy<br />
Could you ever be<br />
A real, real boy<br />
And understand<br />
But you're not a man<br />
<br />
If the past is the problem,<br />
our future could solve them, baby<br />
I could bring you to life<br />
if you let me inside, baby<br />
It'll hurt<br />
but in the end,<br />
you'll be a man<br />
And understand<br />
That you're not a man
