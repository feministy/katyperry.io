<!-- start of lyrics -->
If you want me, a cherry on top, the pick of the peck,<br />
The crème de la crop.<br />
If you want me you better do better than that tonight.<br />
Oh, Oh.<br />
If you want me, it takes more than a wink,<br />
And more than a drink and more than you think.<br />
If you want me you're gonna have to break the bank, tonight.<br />
Cause some don't have the patience, some call me high-maintenance<br />
But you pay the bill, cause, that's the deal.<br />
<br />
If you wanna ride, just name your price don't play cheap, with your heart<br />
Don't make a bet if you can't write the check, for me, for me.<br />
Cause I can be bought, but you'll pay the cost<br />
If you can afford me<br />
<br />
If you want me, I'm not a piece of ass, a one night stand, a storage shed<br />
I think you better walk by, tonight<br />
Oh, no.<br />
If you want me, then stop begging I don't put out for charity<br />
If you want me there's no discount price tonight<br />
But I don't need your dollar bills I just want something real<br />
Cause, nothing's free, except a lovin' me<br />
<br />
If you wanna ride, just name your price don't play cheap, with your heart<br />
Don't make a bet if you can't write the check, for me, for me.<br />
Cause I can be bought, but you'll pay the cost<br />
If you can afford me<br />
<br />
If you want me, a cherry on top,<br />
The pick of the peck, the crème de la crop<br />
<br />
If you wanna ride, just name your price don't play cheap, with your heart<br />
Don't make a bet if you can't write the check, for me, for me.<br />
Cause I can be bought, but you'll pay the cost<br />
If you can afford -<br />
<br />
If you wanna ride, just name your price don't play cheap, with your heart<br />
Don't make a bet if you can't write the check, for me, for me.<br />
Cause I can be bought, but you'll pay the cost<br />
If you can afford me
