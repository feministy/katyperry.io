<!-- start of lyrics -->
You change your mind<br />
Like a girl changes clothes.<br />
Yeah, you, PMS<br />
Like a bitch<br />
I would know<br />
And you over think<br />
Always speak<br />
Critically<br />
<br />
I should know<br />
That you're no good for me<br />
<br />
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br />
'Cause you're hot then you're cold<br />
You're yes then you're no<br />
You're in then you're out<br />
You're up then you're down<br />
You're wrong when it's right<br />
It's black and it's white<br />
We fight, we break up<br />
We kiss, we make up<br />
(you) You don't really wanna stay, no<br />
(you) But you don't really wanna go-o<br />
You're hot then you're cold<br />
You're yes then you're no<br />
You're in then you're out<br />
You're up then you're down<br />
<br />
We used to be<br />
Just like twins<br />
So in sync<br />
The same energy<br />
Now's a dead battery<br />
Used to laugh 'bout nothing<br />
Now you're plain boring<br />
<br />
I should know that<br />
You're not gonna change<br />
<br />
<i>[Chorus]</i><br />
<br />
Someone call the doctor<br />
Got a case of a love bi-polar<br />
Stuck on a roller coaster<br />
Can't get off this ride<br />
<br />
You change your mind<br />
Like a girl changes clothes<br />
<br />
'Cause you're hot then you're cold<br />
You're yes then you're no<br />
You're in then you're out<br />
You're up then you're down<br />
You're wrong when it's right<br />
It's black and it's white<br />
We fight, we break up<br />
We kiss, we make up<br />
<br />
You're hot then you're cold<br />
You're yes then you're no<br />
You're in then you're out<br />
You're up then you're down<br />
You're wrong when it's right<br />
It's black and it's white<br />
We fight, we break up<br />
We kiss, we make up<br />
(you) You don't really wanna stay, no<br />
(you) But you don't really wanna go-o<br />
You're hot then you're cold<br />
You're yes then you're no<br />
You're in then you're out<br />
You're up then you're down, down...
