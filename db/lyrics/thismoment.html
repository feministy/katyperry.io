<!-- start of lyrics -->
Can you tell me, who called the race?<br />
Can anyone stay in one place?<br />
And when you get to the finish line<br />
Will you wish for more time?<br />
I say one day<br />
One day you will<br />
But maybe one day you will find<br />
That you just can't push rewind<br />
<br />
All we have is this moment<br />
Tomorrow's unspoken<br />
Yesterday is history<br />
So why don't you be here with me?<br />
All we have is this moment<br />
To put our love into motion<br />
Yesterday is history<br />
So why don't you be here with me?<br />
Be here with me now<br />
<br />
Do you ever think that, we're just chasing our tails?<br />
Like life is one big fast treadmill<br />
And we pop what is prescribed<br />
If it gets us first prize<br />
But you know who I, who I think will win<br />
Are the ones that love loving<br />
Are the ones that take the time<br />
<br />
All we have is this moment<br />
Tomorrow's unspoken<br />
Yesterday is history<br />
So why don't you be here with me?<br />
All we have is this moment<br />
To put our love into motion<br />
Yesterday is history<br />
So why don't you be here with me?<br />
Be here with me now<br />
<br />
Be here with me now<br />
'Cause the future is right now, right in front on you<br />
Don't let the clock, the clock tell you what to do<br />
A future is right now, I'm in front of you<br />
Baby don't blink and miss<br />
<br />
This moment<br />
Tomorrow's unspoken<br />
Yesterday is history<br />
So why don't you be here with me?<br />
All we have is this moment<br />
To put our love into motion<br />
Yesterday is history<br />
So why don't you be here with me?<br />
Be here with me now
