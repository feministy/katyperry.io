<!-- start of lyrics -->
Comparisons are easily done<br />
Once you've had a taste of perfection<br />
Like an apple hanging from a tree<br />
I picked the ripest one<br />
I still got the seed<br />
<br />
You said move on<br />
Where do I go?<br />
I guess second best<br />
Is all I will know<br />
<br />
'Cause when I'm with him<br />
I am thinking of you<br />
Thinking of you<br />
What you would do if<br />
You were the one<br />
Who was spending the night<br />
Oh I wish that I<br />
Was looking into your eyes<br />
<br />
You're like an Indian summer<br />
In the middle of winter<br />
Like a hard candy<br />
With a surprise center<br />
How do I get better<br />
Once I've had the best?<br />
You said there's<br />
Tons of fish in the water<br />
So the waters I will test<br />
<br />
He kissed my lips<br />
I taste your mouth<br />
He pulled me in<br />
I was disgusted with myself<br />
<br />
'Cause when I'm with him<br />
I am thinking of you<br />
Thinking of you<br />
What you would do if<br />
You were the one<br />
Who was spending the night<br />
Oh I wish that I<br />
Was looking into...<br />
<br />
You're the best<br />
And yes I do regret<br />
How I could let myself<br />
Let you go<br />
Now, now the lesson's learned<br />
I touched it I was burned<br />
Oh I think you should know<br />
<br />
'Cause when I'm with him<br />
I am thinking of you<br />
Thinking of you<br />
What you would do if<br />
You were the one<br />
Who was spending the night<br />
Oh I wish that I<br />
Was looking into your eyes<br />
Looking into your eyes<br />
Looking into your eyes<br />
Oh won't you walk through<br />
And bust in the door<br />
And take me away<br />
Oh no more mistakes<br />
'Cause in your eyes I'd like to stay... stay.
