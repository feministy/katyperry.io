<!-- start of lyrics -->
I lost myself in fear of losing you<br />
I wish I didn't do<br />
But I did<br />
I lost my own, my own identity<br />
Forgot that you picked me for me<br />
<br />
But now, I don't negotiate with insecurities<br />
They always seem to get the best of me<br />
I found I had to love myself, the way I wanted you to...<br />
<br />
...love me,<br />
No more second guessing<br />
No, there’s no more questioning<br />
I’ll be the one defining who I'm gonna be<br />
No concealing feelings, or changing seasonally<br />
I’m gonna love myself, the way I want you to love me<br />
<br />
Sometimes I wish my skin was a costume<br />
That I could just unzip<br />
And strip<br />
But who I am is who I'm meant to be<br />
And it's who you are in love, in love with<br />
<br />
So now, I don't negotiate with insecurities<br />
They're gonna have to take a back seat<br />
I know I have to love myself, the way I want you to...<br />
<br />
...love me,<br />
No more second guessing<br />
No, there’s no more questioning<br />
I’ll be the one defining who I'm gonna be<br />
No concealing feelings, or changing seasonally<br />
I’m gonna love myself, the way I want you to love me<br />
<br />
<i>[2x]</i><br />
No more standing in my own way<br />
Let's go deeper, let's get closer<br />
No more standing in my own way<br />
(I want you to love me)<br />
<br />
No more second guessing<br />
No, there’s no more questioning<br />
I’ll be the one defining who I'm gonna be<br />
No concealing my feelings, or changing seasonally<br />
I’m gonna love myself, the way I want you to love me<br />
<br />
No more second guessing<br />
No, there’s no more questioning<br />
I’ll be the one defining who I'm gonna be<br />
No concealing feelings, or changing seasonally<br />
I’m gonna love myself, the way I want you to love me
