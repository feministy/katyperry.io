<!-- start of lyrics -->
I saw a spider, I didn't scream<br />
'Cause I can belch the alphabet<br />
Just double dog dare me<br />
And I chose guitar over ballet<br />
And I take these suckers down<br />
'Cause they just get in my way<br />
<br />
The way you look at me is kinda like a little sister<br />
Your high five, your goodbyes<br />
And it leaves me nothing but blisters<br />
<br />
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br />
So I don't wanna be one of the boys<br />
One of your guys<br />
Just give me a chance to prove to you tonight<br />
That I just wanna be one of the girls<br />
Pretty in pearls<br />
Not one of the boys<br />
<br />
So over the summer something changed<br />
I started reading "Seventeen" and shaving my legs<br />
And I studied "Lolita" religiously<br />
And I walked right into school and caught you staring at me<br />
<br />
'Cause I know what you know<br />
But now you're gonna have to take a number<br />
It's OK<br />
Maybe one day<br />
But not until you give me my diamond ring<br />
<br />
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br />
'Cause I don't wanna be one of the boys<br />
One of your guys<br />
Just give me a chance to prove to you tonight<br />
That I just wanna be your homecoming queen<br />
Pin-up poster dream<br />
Not one of the boys<br />
<br />
I wanna be a flower<br />
Not a dirty weed<br />
I wanna smell like roses<br />
Not a baseball team<br />
And I swear maybe one day you're gonna<br />
Wanna make out, make out, make out with me<br />
<br />
(Don't wanna be) don't wanna be<br />
(Don't wanna be) don't wanna be<br />
(Don't wanna be)<br />
<br />
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br />
'Cause I don't wanna be one of the boys<br />
One of your guys<br />
Just give me a chance to prove to you tonight<br />
That I just wanna be one of the girls<br />
Pretty in pearls<br />
And not one of the boys
