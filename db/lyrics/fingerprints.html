<!-- start of lyrics -->
Voted most likely to end up on the back of a milk box drink<br />
Looks like I'm letting them down<br />
Cause seven, seventy-five isn't worth an hour of my hard work and time<br />
When you can't afford half the shit they advertise<br />
Oh I'm worth more then they ask for then the toe-tag generation full of regret<br />
Oh I won't settle no, oh I can't settle<br />
<br />
I wanna break the mold, I wanna break the stereotype<br />
Fist in the air I'm not going down with out a fight<br />
It's my life and I'm not sitting on the sidelines watching<br />
It pass me by<br />
I'm leaving you my legacy<br />
I gotta make my mark<br />
I gotta run it hard<br />
I want you to remember me<br />
I'm leaving my fingerprints<br />
I'm leaving my fingerprints<br />
I'm leaving my fingerprints on you<br />
<br />
Representing you and me<br />
Don't you wanna go down in history?<br />
Rather then end up begging on the streets<br />
Trading under table favors for a place to sleep<br />
Cause I'm worth more then this so stop writing prescriptions for my Ritalin<br />
I can't focus my attention<br />
<br />
I wanna break the mold, I wanna break the stereotype<br />
Fist in the air I'm not going down with out a fight<br />
It's my life and I'm not sitting on the sidelines watching<br />
It pass me by<br />
I'm leaving you my legacy<br />
I gotta make my mark<br />
I gotta run it hard<br />
I want you to remember me<br />
I'm leaving my fingerprints<br />
I'm leaving my fingerprints<br />
Don't give up<br />
Don't give in<br />
Build your house on the rock<br />
Oh not in the sand, in the sand, in the sand<br />
<br />
It's my life and I'm not sitting on the sidelines watching<br />
It pass me by<br />
I'm leaving you my legacy<br />
I gotta make my mark<br />
I gotta run it hard<br />
I want you to remember me<br />
(I want you to remember me)<br />
It's my life and I'm not sitting on the sidelines watching<br />
It pass me by<br />
I'm leaving you my legacy<br />
I gotta make my mark<br />
I gotta run it hard<br />
I want you to remember me<br />
Cause I'm leaving my fingerprints<br />
I'm leaving my fingerprints<br />
I'm leaving my fingerprints, in the end
