<!-- start of lyrics -->
Is Mercury in retrograde?<br />
Or is that the excuse that I've always made?<br />
'Cause I wanna blame you,<br />
But I can only blame myself<br />
<br />
Yeah, it's easy to throw you under the bus<br />
Or call you crazy, while filling my cup<br />
I say these things to hurt you<br />
But I only hurt myself<br />
Oh, I can only take responsibility for me<br />
<br />
It takes two, two sides to every story<br />
Not just you<br />
I can't keep ignoring<br />
I admit half of it, I'm not that innocent, oh yeah<br />
<br />
It takes two, two sides to every story<br />
Not just me<br />
You can't keep ignoring<br />
But let me be first baby to say "I'm sorry", "I'm sorry"<br />
<br />
I face my demons, yeah, I paid my dues<br />
I had to grow up, I wish you could too<br />
I wanted to save you, but I can only save myself<br />
<br />
Oh, I can only be the change I want to see<br />
Yeah, to see<br />
<br />
It takes two, two sides to every story<br />
Not just you<br />
I can't keep ignoring<br />
I admit half of it, I'm not that innocent, yeah ohh<br />
<br />
It takes two, two sides to every story<br />
Not just me<br />
You can't keep ignoring<br />
But let me be first baby to say "I'm sorry", "I'm sorry"<br />
<br />
I point my finger but it does me no good<br />
I look in the mirror and it tells me the truth, yeah<br />
Why all these lessons always learned the hard way<br />
Is it too late to change?<br />
<br />
Ohh, It takes two, two sides to every story<br />
Not just you<br />
I can't keep ignoring<br />
And I admit half of it, I'm not that innocent, oh<br />
<br />
It takes two, two sides to every story<br />
Not just me<br />
You can't keep ignoring<br />
But let me be first baby to say "I'm sorry", "I'm sorry", "I'm sorry"
