Oh, no.<br />
<br />
<i>[Juicy J:]</i><br />
Yeah<br />
Ya'll know what it is<br />
Katy Perry<br />
Juicy J, aha.<br />
Let's rage<br />
<br />
<i>[Katy Perry:]</i><br />
I knew you were<br />
You were gonna come to me<br />
And here you are<br />
But you better choose carefully<br />
‘Cause I, I’m capable of anything<br />
Of anything and everything<br />
<br />
Make me your Aphrodite<br />
Make me your one and only<br />
But don’t make me your enemy, your enemy, your enemy<br />
<br />
So you wanna play with magic<br />
Boy, you should know what you're falling for<br />
Baby do you dare to do this?<br />
Cause I’m coming at you like a dark horse<br />
Are you ready for, ready for<br />
A perfect storm, perfect storm<br />
Cause once you’re mine, once you’re mine<br />
There’s no going back<br />
<br />
Mark my words<br />
This love will make you levitate<br />
Like a bird<br />
Like a bird without a cage<br />
But down to earth<br />
If you choose to walk away, don’t walk away<br />
<br />
It’s in the palm of your hand now baby<br />
It’s a yes or no, no maybe<br />
So just be sure before you give it all to me<br />
All to me, give it all to me<br />
<br />
So you wanna play with magic<br />
Boy, you should know what you're falling for<br />
Baby do you dare to do this?<br />
Cause I’m coming at you like a dark horse<br />
Are you ready for, ready for<br />
A perfect storm, perfect storm<br />
Cause once you’re mine, once you’re mine (love trippin')<br />
There’s no going back<br />
<br />
<i>[Juicy J - Rap Verse]</i><br />
Uh<br />
She’s a beast<br />
I call her Karma (come back)<br />
She eats your heart out<br />
Like Jeffrey Dahmer (woo)<br />
Be careful<br />
Try not to lead her on<br />
Shorty’s heart is on steroids<br />
Cause her love is so strong<br />
You may fall in love<br />
When you meet her<br />
If you get the chance you better keep her<br />
She's sweet as pie but if you break her heart<br />
She'll turn cold as a freezer<br />
That fairy tale ending with a knight in shining armor<br />
She can be my Sleeping Beauty<br />
I’m gon’ put her in a coma<br />
Woo!<br />
Damn I think I love her<br />
Shorty so bad, I’m sprung and I don’t care<br />
She ride me like a roller coaster<br />
Turned the bedroom into a fair (a fair!)<br />
Her love is like a drug<br />
I was tryna hit it and quit it<br />
But lil' mama so dope<br />
I messed around and got addicted<br />
<br />
So you wanna play with magic<br />
Boy, you should know what you're falling for (you should know)<br />
Baby do you dare to do this?<br />
Cause I’m coming at you like a dark horse (like a dark horse)<br />
Are you ready for, ready for (ready for)<br />
A perfect storm, perfect storm (a perfect storm)<br />
Cause once you’re mine, once you’re mine (mine)<br />
