<!-- start of lyrics -->
Flowers in her hair, she don't care<br />
Peach-pink lips, yeah, everybody stares<br />
You think you've seen her in a magazine<br />
It's like she walked right out of your dreams<br />
<br />
Black ray-bans, you know she's with the band<br />
Passport stamps, she's cosmopolitan<br />
Yeah, she runs a place at Penny lane<br />
Yeah, you're lucky if you're on her plane<br />
<br />
From Tokyo to Mexico, to Rio<br />
<br />
That girl’s a trip,<br />
A one way ticket<br />
Takes you miles high, so high,<br />
'cause she’s got that one international smile<br />
Catch her if you can<br />
Yeah, she's so in demand<br />
Takes you miles high, so high,<br />
'cause she’s got that one international smile<br />
<br />
She's got that, je ne sais quoi, you know it<br />
So tres chic, yeah, she's a classic<br />
But she's pole dancing so fancy free<br />
Yeah, she dances to her own beat<br />
<br />
'Cause she's the muse and the artist<br />
Always leaves the trail of stardust<br />
'Cause she's a little bit of "Yoko",<br />
And she's a little bit of "Ono"<br />
<br />
From LA, Miami, to New York City<br />
<br />
That girl’s a trip,<br />
A one way ticket<br />
Takes you miles high, so high,<br />
'cause she’s got that one international smile<br />
Catch her if you can<br />
Yeah, she's so in demand<br />
Takes you miles high, so high,<br />
'cause she’s got that one international smile<br />
<br />
Please fasten your seatbelts and make sure your champagne glasses are empty<br />
We are now approaching the runway, so get ready for take off<br />
<br />
That girl’s a trip,<br />
A one way ticket<br />
Takes you miles high, so high,<br />
'cause she’s got that one international smile<br />
Catch her if you can<br />
Yeah, she's so in demand<br />
Takes you miles high, so high,<br />
'cause she’s got that one international smile
