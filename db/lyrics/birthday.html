<!-- start of lyrics -->
I heard you're feeling nothing's going bright<br />
Why don't you let me stop by?<br />
The clock is ticking, running out of time<br />
So we should party all night<br />
<br />
So cover your eyes,<br />
I have a surprise<br />
I hope you got a healthy appetite<br />
If you wanna dance,<br />
If you want it all<br />
You know that I'm the girl that you should call<br />
<br />
Boy, when you're with me<br />
I'll give you a taste<br />
Make it like your birthday everyday<br />
I know you like it sweet<br />
So you can have your cake<br />
Give you something good to celebrate<br />
<br />
So make a wish<br />
I'll make it like your birthday everyday<br />
I'll be your gift<br />
Give you something good to celebrate<br />
<br />
Pop your confetti<br />
We can carry on<br />
So hot and heavy<br />
Till dawn<br />
I got you spinning<br />
Like a disco ball<br />
All night they're playing<br />
Your song<br />
<br />
We're living the life<br />
We're doing it right<br />
You're never gonna be unsatisfied<br />
If you wanna dance<br />
If you want it all<br />
You know that I'm the girl that you should call<br />
<br />
Boy, when you're with me<br />
I'll give you a taste<br />
Make it like your birthday everyday<br />
I know you like it sweet<br />
So you can have your cake<br />
Give you something good to celebrate<br />
<br />
So make a wish<br />
I'll make it like your birthday everyday<br />
I'll be your gift<br />
Give you something good to celebrate<br />
<br />
Happy birthday<br />
<br />
So let me get you in your birthday suit<br />
It's time to bring out the big balloons<br />
So let me get you in your birthday suit<br />
It's time to bring out the big, big, big, big, big, big balloons<br />
<br />
Boy, when you're with me<br />
I'll give you a taste<br />
Make it like your birthday everyday<br />
I know you like it sweet<br />
So you can have your cake<br />
Give you something good to celebrate<br />
<br />
Boy, when you're with me<br />
I'll give you a taste<br />
Make it like your birthday everyday<br />
I know you like it sweet<br />
So you can have your cake<br />
Give you something good to celebrate<br />
<br />
So make a wish<br />
I'll make it like your birthday everyday<br />
I'll be your gift<br />
Give you something good to celebrate<br />
<br />
Happy birthday
