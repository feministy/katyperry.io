(This is how we do, This is how we do)<br />
Oh oh<br />
Sipping on Ros√©, Silver Lake sun, coming up all lazy<br />
(This is how we do)<br />
Slow cooking pancakes for my boy, still up, still fresh as a Daisy<br />
Playing ping pong all night long, everything's all neon and hazy<br />
(This is how we do)<br />
<br />
Chanel this, Chanel that, hell yeah<br />
All my girls vintage Chanel baby<br />
<br />
It's no big deal, it's no big deal, it's no big deal<br />
This is no big deal<br />
<br />
This is how we do, yeah, chilling, laid back<br />
Straight stuntin' yeah we do it like that<br />
This is how we do, do do do do, this is how we do<br />
<br />
This is how we do, yeah, chilling, laid back<br />
Straight stuntin' yeah we do it like that<br />
This is how we do, do do do do, this is how we do<br />
<br />
Big hoops, and maroon lips, my clique hoppin' in my Maserati<br />
(This is how we do)<br />
Santa Barbara, chique, at La Super Rica, grabbing tacos, checking out hotties<br />
Now we talking astrology, getting our nails did, all Japanese-y<br />
(This is how we do)<br />
Day drinking at the Wildcats, sucking real bad at Mariah karaoke<br />
<br />
It's no big deal, it's no big deal, it's no big deal<br />
This is no big deal<br />
<br />
This is how we do, yeah, chilling, laid back<br />
Straight stuntin' yeah we do it like that<br />
This is how we do, do do do do, this is how we do<br />
<br />
This is how we do, yeah, chilling, laid back<br />
Straight stuntin' yeah we do it like that<br />
This is how we do, do do do do, this is how we do<br />
<br />
This one goes out to the ladies at breakfast in last night's dress<br />
(It's how we do, straight stuntin' like that)<br />
Uh-huh, I see you<br />
Yo, this goes out to all you kids that still have their cars at the club valet and it's Tuesday<br />
(This is how we do yeah straight stuntin like that)<br />
Yo, shout out to all you kids, buying bottle service, with your rent money<br />
Respect<br />
<br />
This is how we do, yeah, chilling, laid back<br />
Straight stuntin' yeah we do it like that<br />
This is how we do, do do do do, this is how we do<br />
<br />
This is how we do, yeah, chilling, laid back<br />
Straight stuntin' yeah we do it like that<br />
This is how we do, do do do do, this is how we do<br />
<br />
This is how we do<br />
This goes out to all you people going to bed with a ten and waking up with a two<br />
This is how we do (straight stuntin like that)<br />
Ha, not me<br />
<br />
This is how we do, yeah, chilling, laid back<br />
Straight stuntin' ya we do it like that<br />
This is how we do, do do do do, this is how we do<br />
<br />
What? Wait. No, no, no, no.<br />
Bring the beat back.<br />
That's right<br />
<br />
(This is how we do), oh oh<br />
This is how we do), oh oh
