<!-- start of lyrics -->
I leave the gas on<br />
Walk the alleys in the dark<br />
Sleep with candles burning<br />
I leave the door unlocked<br />
I'm weaving a rope and<br />
Running all the red lights<br />
Did I get your attention<br />
'Cause I'm sending<br />
All the signs that<br />
The clock is ticking<br />
And I'll be giving<br />
My two weeks<br />
<br />
Pick your favorite<br />
Shade of black<br />
You'd best<br />
Prepare a speech<br />
Say something funny<br />
Say something sweet<br />
But don't say<br />
That you loved me<br />
<br />
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br />
'cause I'm still breathing<br />
But we've been<br />
Dead for awhile<br />
This sickness has no cure<br />
We're going down for sure<br />
Already lost our grip<br />
Best abandon ship<br />
<br />
Maybe I was too pale<br />
Maybe I was too fat<br />
Maybe you had better<br />
Better luck in the sack<br />
No formal education<br />
And I swore way too much<br />
But I swear<br />
You didn't fucking care<br />
'Cause we were in love<br />
<br />
So as I write this letter<br />
And shed my last tear<br />
It's all for the better<br />
That we end this here<br />
Let's close this chapter<br />
Say one last prayer<br />
But don't say<br />
That you loved me<br />
<br />
<i>[Chorus]</i><br />
<br />
I'm still breathing<br />
But we've been<br />
Dead for awhile<br />
This sickness has no cure<br />
We're going down for sure<br />
Already lost a grip<br />
Best abandon ship
