<!-- start of lyrics -->
I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath<br />
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess<br />
So I sat quietly, agreed politely<br />
I guess that I forgot I had a choice<br />
I let you push me past the breaking point<br />
I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything<br />
<br />
You held me down, but I got up (HEY!)<br />
Already brushing off the dust<br />
You hear my voice, you hear that sound<br />
Like thunder gonna shake the ground<br />
You held me down, but I got up (HEY!)<br />
Get ready 'cause I’ve had enough<br />
I see it all, I see it now<br />
<br />
<i>[Chorus]</i><br />
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter, dancing through the fire<br />
'Cause I am a champion and you’re gonna hear me roar<br />
Louder, louder than a lion<br />
'Cause I am a champion and you’re gonna hear me roar<br />
Oh oh oh oh oh oh<br />
Oh oh oh oh oh oh<br />
Oh oh oh oh oh oh<br />
You’re gonna hear me roar<br />
<br />
Now I’m floating like a butterfly<br />
Stinging like a bee I earned my stripes<br />
I went from zero, to my own hero<br />
<br />
You held me down, but I got up (HEY!)<br />
Already brushing off the dust<br />
You hear my voice, you hear that sound<br />
Like thunder gonna shake the ground<br />
You held me down, but I got up (HEY!)<br />
Get ready ’cause I’ve had enough<br />
I see it all, I see it now<br />
<br />
<i>[Chorus]</i><br />
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter, dancing through the fire<br />
‘Cause I am a champion and you’re gonna hear me roar<br />
Louder, louder than a lion<br />
‘Cause I am a champion and you’re gonna hear me roar<br />
Oh oh oh oh oh oh<br />
Oh oh oh oh oh oh<br />
Oh oh oh oh oh oh<br />
You’re gonna hear me roar<br />
Oh oh oh oh oh oh<br />
Oh oh oh oh oh oh<br />
You'll hear me roar<br />
Oh oh oh oh oh oh<br />
You're gonna hear me roar...<br />
<br />
Ro-oar, ro-oar, ro-oar, ro-oar, ro-oar<br />
<br />
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter, dancing through the fire<br />
‘Cause I am a champion and you’re gonna hear me roar<br />
Louder, louder than a lion<br />
‘Cause I am a champion and you’re gonna hear me roar<br />
Oh oh oh oh oh oh<br />
Oh oh oh oh oh oh<br />
Oh oh oh oh oh oh<br />
You’re gonna hear me roar<br />
Oh oh oh oh oh oh<br />
Oh oh oh oh oh oh<br />
You'll hear me roar<br />
Oh oh oh oh oh oh<br />
You're gonna hear me roar...
