<!-- start of lyrics -->
Was 27 surviving my return of Saturn<br />
A long vacation didn’t sound so bad<br />
Was full of secrets locked up tight like iron mountain<br />
Running on empty so out of gas<br />
<br />
Thought I wasn’t enough<br />
Found I wasn’t so tough<br />
Layin’ on the bathroom floor<br />
We were living on a fault line<br />
And I felt the fault was all mine<br />
Couldn’t take it anymore<br />
<br />
By the grace of God (there was no other way)<br />
I picked myself back up (I knew I had to stay)<br />
I put one foot in front of the other<br />
And I looked in the mirror and decided to stay<br />
Wasn’t gonna let love take me out that way<br />
<br />
I thank my sister for keeping my head above the water<br />
When the truth was like swallowing sand<br />
Now every morning, there is no more mourning<br />
Oh, I can finally see myself again<br />
<br />
I know I am enough<br />
Possible to be loved<br />
It was not about me<br />
Now I have to rise above<br />
Let the universe call the bluff<br />
Yeah, the truth’ll set you free<br />
<br />
By the grace of God (there was no other way)<br />
I picked myself back up (I knew I had to stay)<br />
I put one foot in front of the other<br />
And I looked in the mirror and decided to stay<br />
Wasn’t gonna let love take me out, oh, that way,<br />
No, that way, no<br />
Not in the name of love<br />
In the name of love<br />
That way, no,<br />
That way, no<br />
I am not giving up<br />
<br />
By the grace of God<br />
I picked myself back up<br />
I put one foot in front of the other<br />
And I looked in the mirror (looked in the mirror)<br />
Looked in the mirror (looked in the mirror)<br />
<br />
By the grace of God (there was no other way)<br />
I picked myself back up (I knew I had to stay)<br />
I put one foot in front of the other<br />
And I looked in the mirror and decided to stay<br />
Wasn’t gonna let love take me out that way
