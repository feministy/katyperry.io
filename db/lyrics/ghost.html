<!-- start of lyrics -->
You sent a text<br />
It's like the wind changed your mind<br />
We were best friends<br />
Yeah, we were building our life<br />
<br />
With every kiss, and every letter<br />
Every promise of forever, oh<br />
But you hit "Send"<br />
And disappeared in front of my eyes<br />
<br />
And now you’re just a ghost<br />
When I look back never would have known that<br />
You could be so cold<br />
Like a stranger vanish like a vapor<br />
There's just an echo where your heart used to be<br />
Now I see it clearly<br />
And there's just a pillow where your head used to sleep<br />
My vision's 20/20<br />
I see through you now<br />
<br />
Something has died<br />
Now that I have made up my mind<br />
I'll be alright<br />
It doesn't harm me at night<br />
<br />
'Cause every gift, and every letter,<br />
Every promise of forever<br />
Now, it's out of sight<br />
Like you were never alive<br />
<br />
And now you’re just a ghost<br />
When I look back never would have known that<br />
You could be so cold<br />
Like a stranger vanish like a vapor<br />
There's just an echo where your heart used to be<br />
Now I see it clearly<br />
And there's just a pillow where your head used to sleep<br />
My vision's 20/20<br />
I see through you now<br />
<br />
Now, now, now, now, now<br />
Now, now, now, now, now<br />
<br />
So rest in peace<br />
I see you on the other side<br />
<br />
And now you’re just a ghost<br />
When I look back never would have known that<br />
You could be so cold<br />
Like a stranger vanish like a vapor<br />
There's just an echo where your heart used to be<br />
Now I see it clearly<br />
And there's just a pillow where your head used to sleep<br />
My vision's 20/20<br />
I see through you now<br />
<br />
Now, now, now, now<br />
<br />
I see through you now<br />
<br />
Now, now, now, now<br />
<br />
I see through you now
