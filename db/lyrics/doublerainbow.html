<!-- start of lyrics -->
You're a one of a one<br />
A one of a kind<br />
That you only find once in a lifetime<br />
Made to fit like a fingerprint<br />
A code that clicks open a gold mine<br />
<br />
They say one man's trash is another man's treasure<br />
When I found you, it was all pitter-patter<br />
<br />
Secretly, I hit the lottery<br />
'Cause you're brighter than all of the Northern Lights<br />
You speak to me, even in my dreams<br />
Wouldn't let you go for even the highest price<br />
<br />
They say one man's trash is another girl's treasure<br />
So if it's up to me, I'm gonna keep you forever<br />
<br />
'Cause I understand you, we see eye to eye<br />
Like a double rainbow in the sky<br />
And wherever you go, so will I<br />
'Cause a double rainbow is hard to find<br />
<br />
Was a phenomenon when you came along<br />
Yeah, our chemistry was more than science<br />
It was deafening, loud like lightning, it was striking<br />
You couldn't deny it<br />
<br />
They say one man's trash is another man's treasure<br />
The two of us together, make everything glitter<br />
<br />
'Cause I understand you, we see eye to eye<br />
Like a double rainbow in the sky<br />
And wherever you go, so will I<br />
'Cause a double rainbow is hard to find<br />
<br />
To the bottom of the sea, I'd go to find you<br />
Climb the highest peak to be right beside you<br />
Every step I take, I'm keeping you in mind<br />
<br />
'Cause I understand you, we see eye to eye<br />
Like a double rainbow in the sky<br />
And wherever you go, so will I<br />
'Cause a double rainbow is hard to find<br />
<br />
It's hard to find,<br />
It's hard to find<br />
Once in a lifetime<br />
Once in a lifetime<br />
Once in a lifetime
