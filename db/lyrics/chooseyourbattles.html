<!-- start of lyrics -->
You are my hurt locker lover<br />
Keep me walking on a wire<br />
Don't know when you'll blow<br />
So I tip toe through your triggered mine<br />
You fight me but I'm on your side<br />
Defeated, now retreating<br />
<br />
Why you trying to make me your enemy<br />
All I really need is a little peace<br />
I just wanna be your lover<br />
Oh, this is not a competition<br />
So baby why the ammunition<br />
I don't wanna be the last one standing<br />
<br />
Choose your battles, babe<br />
Then you win the war<br />
Stop digging your own grave<br />
When there's so much to live for<br />
<br />
Choose your battles, babe<br />
Cause I'm not fighting anymore<br />
I am not fighting anymore<br />
<br />
I try to pick off your red flags<br />
But dancing up on broken glass<br />
Your mind games hit like grenades<br />
You're cursed just like the Kennedys<br />
But you somehow get me on my knees, defeated<br />
Not retreated<br />
<br />
Why you trying to make me your enemy<br />
All I really need is a little peace<br />
I just wanna be your lover<br />
Oh, this is not a competition<br />
So baby why the ammunition<br />
I don't wanna be the last one standing<br />
<br />
Choose your battles, babe<br />
Then you win the war<br />
Stop digging your own grave<br />
When there's so much to live for<br />
<br />
Choose your battles, babe<br />
Cause I'm not fighting anymore<br />
I am not fighting anymore<br />
<br />
If you wanna go, then go<br />
If you wanna stay then stay<br />
Cause I don't wanna fight no more, baby<br />
I am not fighting anymore<br />
If you wanna go, then go<br />
If you wanna stay then stay<br />
I don't wanna fight no more<br />
Anyway, I am not fighting anymore<br />
<br />
If you wanna go, then go<br />
If you wanna stay then stay<br />
Cause I don't wanna fight no more, baby<br />
<br />
(Stop digging your own grave<br />
Within, so much to live for)<br />
<br />
Choose your battles, babe<br />
Cause I'm not fighting anymore<br />
I am not fighting anymore<br />
<br />
Anyway, I am not fighting anymore<br />
<br />
If you wanna go, then go<br />
If you wanna stay then stay<br />
<br />
Cause I don't wanna fight no more, baby
